<h2>"You're bad men but you're our bad men"</h2>
<hr width="35%">
<p>This quote will stick around you for a long time, while you watch the stem-winding epic period-drama show Peaky Blinders.
The show is a dramatic tale of a criminal family, indisputably headed by Tommy Shelby with a post-war Birmingham as backdrop. It revolves around street fights, drug deals, murder, love and betrayal.</p>

<p>The theatrical flair of the show is consistent with elaborate dialogues spoken with a vivid countenance in almost every scene.The characters are well curated. They are neither completely dark and definitely not good but they are somewhere in the middle, fighting with their own demons. To top it, they are all extremely fashionable.Tommy Shelby, his brothers and his crew all wear a uniform based on a three piece suit, oxford laced boots, a newsboy cap, a detachable collar shirt, and a heavy black overcoat. Well, although Tommy and his boys will simply steal your heart, the women in the show will break it without any disclaimer. Incorporation of a cast full of incredible and strong willed women brings a sassy touch along with an emotional depth in the narrative.</p>

<p>The cinematography is top notch with every frame a piece of perfection. Speaking of perfection, the contemporary soundtrack is impeccable in regard of the show. The Nick Cave covers and Arctic Monkeys' tracks have been meticulously chosen to depict the violence , grit and glamour of the show. Before you know, you'll be humming to the title track 'Red Right Hand' and playing it on loop. 
Basically, an addictive , action-packed period drama, consisting of emotionally damaged characters with absolute swag. It is a must watch.</p>
